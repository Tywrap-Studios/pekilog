This mod logs private messages sent through commands, <u>we, Tywrap Studios, are not responsible for misuse of this feature.<u>
It is suggested to make your players accept a certain Privacy Policy that states you as a server are allowed to log these commands.
<br/>Alternatively, a config option is in-dev, you can turn the logging off if you wish not to get in this type of trouble.

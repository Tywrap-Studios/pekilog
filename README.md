This mod logs private messages sent through commands, *we, Tywrap Studios, are not responsible for misuse of this feature.*
It is suggested to make your players accept a certain Privacy Policy that states you as a server are allowed to log these commands.
<br/>Alternatively, we have a very simple config system, you can always turn that logging off if you wish not to get in this type of trouble.
